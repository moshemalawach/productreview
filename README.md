Depends on this smart contract:

Also, you will need nworld-wallet and nulsworldjs projects installed
and perhaps even linked using "npm link" to this one, as we integrate items
from their sourcecode directly.
Both can be found at https://github.com/NULS-World

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# re-link
npm link nulsworldjs
npm link nworld-wallet

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
